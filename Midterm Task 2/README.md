# Midterm Lab Task 2 – Data Cleaning and Transformation Using Power Query Editor
For this task, we are provided with an Uncleaned_DS_jobs.csv dataset (from Kaggle) and tasked with performing data cleaning and transformation using Power Query Editor in Excel to generate meaningful insights.
## STEP 1 – Data Cleaning Process
Load the raw file
Fit Column and row width and height
TRIM extra spaces
Remove NULL values
Remove Duplicates
## STEP 2 – Data Transformation
Salary Estimate Column:
In Power Query, select the Salary Estimate column.
Use Transform > Extract > Text Before Delimiter to remove any characters after the open parenthesis.
Create Min and Max Salary Columns:
Use Add Column > Column from Examples to generate the Min Sal and Max Sal columns from the Salary Estimate column.
Add Role Type Column.
Go to Add Column > Custom Column and use the formula to categorize job titles into roles like Data Scientist, Data Analyst, Data Engineer, etc.
Split Location Column:
Select the Location column and use Transform > Split Column by Delimiter (Comma) to split location into separate columns.
Location Correction:
Create a custom column to correct location values, replacing certain locations (e.g., "New Jersey" to ", NJ", "California" to ", CA").
Handle Negative Values:
Filter out negative values in Competitors and Industry columns.
Clean Company Name:
Remove any unwanted text from the Company Name column using Transform > Replace Values or Remove Text.
## STEP 3 – Screenshots
Before Data Cleaning: (See screenshot of raw data before any transformations were made.)
After Data Cleaning: (See screenshot of cleaned data post-transformation.)
## STEP 4 – Final Output Queries
Here are the final queries after performing all necessary data transformations:
Sal By Role Type dup: A query with job titles categorized by role type.
Sal By Size ref: A query focusing on salary data by company size or another metric.
Sal By State ref: A query analyzing salary data by state/location.
Uncleaned DS Jobs: The original dataset before any transformations.

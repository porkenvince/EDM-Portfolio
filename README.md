# About Me
A short professional biography is a brief summary of your career accomplishments. It provides an overview of your most relevant professional experiences, qualifications, and achievements.
Short professional bios are usually written in the third person and are limited to a few sentences or concise paragraphs. The shorter length works well as a quick introduction for resumes, professional profiles, employer websites, social media accounts, author descriptions, and speaking engagements.
